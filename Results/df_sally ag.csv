This is asking for Melania's 2nd order belief: where does Melania think Sabra would look for the binder? Since Melania does not know the binder was moved, she thinks Sabra would look for the binder in the safe (the original location).

The prompt asks: ""After Amata came back to the house, Amata would think Clem would look for the papaya in...""

This is asking for Amata's 2nd order belief: Where does Amata think Clem would look for the papaya? Since Amata does not know the papaya was moved, she thinks Clem would look for the papaya where it was originally (the coffer).

The response says: ""the drawer. Since Clem was the one who moved the papaya there, Amata would assume that Clem knows its current location. Amata, however, might initially look for the papaya in the coffer, where it was originally found, before...""

This is correct. Amata would think Clem knows the new location (the drawer), so Amata would think Clem would look in the drawer.
